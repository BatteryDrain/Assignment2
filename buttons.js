This simple game captivated the world from old to young, student to professor. Everyone in an English speaking country has heard the name WORDLE. When I got wind of this new free minigame I gave it a try only to see I suck at it. The problem had shown itself. I knocked on my brother's room and gave him a challenge: design a program that helps you beat Wordle every time. He obliged and we were off. Now this wasn't our first time. Since we have had many challenges like this before. When we tried to outcode each other on a website called Scratch by MIT. You can try the WORDLE game with the link below!";

This was achieved by making a display, where the user could input information in different sections to indicate the hints WORDLE gave them. At the time of making the first version, there was this meme about people adding to the end of a word to mean the opposite. If you are reading this, you are deadnâ€™t, hence WORDLEn't. You can try this version for yourself, with the link below!";

I added instructions to the program description on the right but that didn't work, so I added a question mark in the bottom left. If you click it an overlay will show you what the different sections are for. Although I found that if a user is confused they are more likely to give up instead of looking for a help button. There was only one way I could fix these core problems: I needed a redesign. I removed all three sections, leaving only the output section. Instead, I replaced them with an interface inspired by the WORDLE game. I added a draggable tile section to allow the user to tell the program the hints the game gave them.
