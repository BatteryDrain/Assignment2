    <p id="paragraph">
        In the brisk months of October 2021, a game was introduced to the world, WORDLE. This simple game captivated the world from old to young, student to professor. Everyone in an English speaking country has heard the name WORDLE. When I got wind of this new free minigame I gave it a try only to see I suck at it. The problem had shown itself. I knocked on my brother's room and gave him a challenge, design a program that can help you beat wordle every time. He obliged and we were off, now this wasn't our first time, we had had many challenges like this before when we tried to outcode each other on a website called Scratch by MIT. You can try the WORDLE game with the link below!
